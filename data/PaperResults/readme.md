This folder contains all the 3D shapes and the images (snapshots) of the results shown in our paper.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
These 3D shapes and images are included for completeness only. To generate the same 3D shapes shown in "Section 6 - Experimental Results" of our paper, you can use the pre-processed data and the scripts included in this repository: see the Readme file on the root of the repository for details.

This folder is divided into two subfolders 
1) 3D: contains a ZIP file with all the 3D shapes (point clouds and meshes) that we show in our paper.
2) Images: contains a ZIP file with the images (PNG) that we used to create the Figures of our paper.

The ZIP file contained in the subfolder "3D" you can find two types of files:
(*) .obj files: containing each synthesized 3D mesh presented in the results section of our paper. 
(*) .ply files: containing each synthesized point cloud shown in the results section of our paper. 

The subfolder "Images" contains .png files with high resolution versions of the same images contained in each figure of the paper.

NOTES:
(1) Figure 1 in our paper, which we include in the ZIP file located in the subfolder "Images" (Fig1.png), was generated using Blender with the following three synthesized meshes (.obj files):
Blender is free and open source and can be downloaded from: https://www.blender.org/download/
(2) We generated all the other images of the point clouds and meshes included in our paper taking snapshots using the free and open source software Meshlab. Note that we customized in Meshlab the appearance, (i.e., the color for rendering the meshes, and the point size to render the point clouds), before generating these snapshots.
Meshlab can be downloaded from:
